## Engineering Economic Analysis

### Types of Interests

### Time Basis for Compound Interest Calculations

### Discrete Cash Flow Diagrams

### Continuous Cash Flow Diagrams

### Calculations with Cash Flow Diagrams

### Annuities and Discount Factors

```
We defined annuities and derived discount factors that allows conversion between present, future, and annuity values.

Erratum: Slide 4, expression in the parenthesis of the formula for compound interest is (1 + i), not (i + i).
