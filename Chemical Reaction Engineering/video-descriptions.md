## Reactor

### Types of Biochemical Reactors

```
We discussed the types of chemical processes and biochemical reactors. We derived general mass balance using the conservation of mass and applied general mass balance to derive the design equation for reactors. This video is part of the final project of CHEM E 467 in Spring 2023 at the University of Washington.

## Kinetics

### Michaelis–Menten Kinetics

```
We derived the Michaelis-Menten kinetics that describes simple enzymatic reactions with pseudo-steady-state approximation. We linearized the Michaelis-Menten equation into Lineweaver-Burk plot to obtain Michaelis-Menten parameters from experimental data.
