## Centrifugation

```
We discussed separation of solid particles in liquid by sedimentation and centrifugation governed by Stoke's law. Centrifugation can be batch or continuous that can be characterized by g-force and sigma factor. This video is part of the final project of CHEM E 467 in Spring 2023 at the University of Washington.
