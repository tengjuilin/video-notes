## Fluid Interfaces and Capillarity

### Drop Weight Method - Surface Tension Measurement and Adsorption Isotherm Determination

```
We discussed theory of the drop weight method for measuring surface tension and determining adsorption isotherm. We identified objectives of the experiments.

### Wicking Flow in Porous Media

```
We derived the Washburn equation for horizontal capillary and wicking equation for inclined capillary that describes wicking flow. We generalized the Washburn analysis to porous media to describe wicking. We identified objectives and expected results of the experiments.

### Derivation of the Wicking Equation for Inclined Capillary

```
We derived the wicking equation for inclined capillary. We showed if the system is far from equilibrium, wicking equation for inclined capillary reduces to the Washburn equation for horizontal capillary.
