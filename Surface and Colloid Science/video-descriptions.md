## Fluid Interfaces and Capillarity

### Drop Weight Method - Surface Tension Measurement and Adsorption Isotherm Determination

```
We discussed theory of the drop weight method for measuring surface tension and determining adsorption isotherm. We identified objectives of the experiments.

### Derivation of the Wicking Equation for Inclined Capillary

```
We derived the wicking equation for inclined capillary. We showed if the system is far from equilibrium, wicking equation for inclined capillary reduces to the Washburn equation for horizontal capillary.
